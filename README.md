Crime Analysis Database

The objective of our database is to have a centeralized data source that would cater to any crime analysis system. It would be able to provide a efficient database for various use cases such as:

Real Estate - Provide a database to have data visualization for crime rate in a locality.

Law Enforcement - Provide the law enforcement to have a source to gather and tarck the various crimes around their jurisdiction. 

Location Service - Navigation services like Google Maps can have an option to provide the safest route from Point A to Point B.

Tourist locations - Make tourist aware of a particular area's safety before they visit.

The data would be collected through various sources to collate and create a new database that would be able to answer question on the data like how crime has progressed, what type of crimes take place, provide a corelation between various factors(gross income of an area, time etc) and crime committed, etc.



The objective of our project is to identify the crime rate of a certain locality in America and graphically visualise it. 
This will be a collection of information taken from various sources.
Different scenarios this database can benefit:
Real Estate
Law Enforcement
Location Services(Instead of shortest route, we can show the safest route at different times of the day)
Tourist locations

The output which we hope to achieve is:




This is done taking reference from criminal data obtained from the FBI Database, Boston PD, etc.
