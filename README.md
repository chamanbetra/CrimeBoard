Crime Analysis Database

The objective of our database is to have a centeralized data source that would cater to any crime anaysis system. It would be able to provide a efficient database for various use cases such as:
Real Estate - Provide a database to have data visualization for crime rate in a locality.
Law Enforcement - Provide the law enforcement to have a source to gather and tarck the various crimes aroudn their jurisdiction. 
Location Service - Instead of shortest route, we can show the safest route at different times of the day
Tourist locations - Make tourist aware of crimes in an area before they visit.

The data would be collected through various sources to collate and create a new database that would be able to answer question on the data like how crime has progressed, what type of crimes take place, provide a corelation between various factors(gross income of an area, time etc) and crime committed, etc.
