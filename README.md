<h3>Summary</h3>

The objective of our database is to have a centeralized data source that would cater to any crime analysis system. It would be able to provide an efficient database for various use cases such as:
<ul>
<li>Real Estate - Provide a database to have data visualization for crime rate in a locality.</li>

<li>Law Enforcement - Provide the law enforcement to have a source to gather and track the various crimes around their jurisdiction. </li>

<li>Location Service - Navigation services such as Google Maps can have an option to provide the safest route from Point A to Point B.</li>

<li>Tourist Destinations - Make tourists aware of a particular area's safety before they visit.</li>
</ul>
The data would be collected through various sources to collate and create a new database that would be able to answer questions on the data like how crime has progressed, what type of crimes take place and their severity, provide a corelation between various factors(gross income of an area, time etc) and crime committed, etc.
